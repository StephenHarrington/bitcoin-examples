    "\n",
    "This notebook takes the [Bitcoin Developers Reference](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference), specifically the [Bitcoin API](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis), and demonstrates the use of the Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) via python.  We employ the [regression testing mode](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-examples#regtest-mode) of bitcoin, regtest, to start with a clean blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook orders the RPC methods to illustrate how to use the API.  In the [Bitcoin Developers Reference](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference) the RPC methods are in alphabetical order while the python example code below is in *discovery* sequence, starting with creating the genesis block, mining our first bitcoins, sending some to another user and showing updates to the blockchain throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook may be useful for beginners looking for a simple python interface to the Bitcoin API; we use the [python bitcoin module](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib) created by Peter Todd for its simplicity.  As well, the value to the user who is new to python is a simple step by step walk thru of the various methods in the API in an incremental introduction without the confusion of thousands of transactions in a typical block on mainnet."
